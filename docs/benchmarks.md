# Benchmarks

`scripts/benchmark.py` measures subprocess startup and binding generation against
a supplied header. It records every sample's iteration, tool order, output hash,
stderr, size, time, and Linux peak resident memory. The JSON also records tool
versions, commands, CPU model, allowed CPU affinity where available, target, and
emitted function names. One warmup is discarded; measured tool order is shuffled
with a fixed seed. Each command has a 60-second timeout, configurable with `--timeout`.

```console
cargo build --release -p toucan_cli
python3 scripts/benchmark.py /path/to/sqlite3.h \
  --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --sysroot / \
  --allowlist 'sqlite3*' --allowlist 'SQLITE*' --bindgen /path/to/bindgen \
  --iterations 15 --output benchmark-results/sqlite.json
```

Use the same target resource headers with `-I` for both tools. Bindgen runs without
doc comments, layout tests, or rustfmt, with enum name prefixes disabled and signed
macro constants by default, matching the API comparison configuration. Toucan emits compile-time
layout assertions. Matching function names is a useful scope check, but does not
prove identical types, signatures, or complete output equivalence.

The harness measures warm filesystem-cache operation and includes output capture.
An untimed Toucan report discovers header dependencies before the warmup. The
harness hashes those files and both executables before and after measurement; it
saves the results and exits with an error if they changed. These hashes do not
cover headers used only by bindgen or shared libraries. Output hashes reveal
whether a tool produced different output between samples.

Avoid concurrent builds and other heavy workloads while collecting results. The
harness records affinity but does not pin CPUs or control CPU frequency or host
load. Use an external affinity tool when needed and retain that configuration.
It does not measure allocation counts or peak memory on non-Linux hosts. Report
regressions and workload differences, and retain raw JSON when publishing numbers.
Production performance claims require a larger corpus and equivalent-output review.

To compare the optional CLI allocator, build with `--features performance-allocator`
and record it as a separate binary/configuration. Library consumers choose their
own process allocator.
